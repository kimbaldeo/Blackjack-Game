## Future Iterations
1. The ability to make bets before each hand and track the total bets won and lost
2. Animations for the shuffling, dealing and flipping of cards
3. More depth to the dealerPlay function, showing the turn of the dealer rather than the final outcome for more realism. 
4. The option to "split" during the game, a move when the player splits their hand into 2 and plays each hand.
