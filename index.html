        <h4>How to Play</h4>
            <p>The object of the game is to beat the dealer by getting a sum of cards close to 21 without going over. <br>
                Numbered cards hold their face value, while face cards are 10 and Ace can be 1 or 11.<br>
                The Player is given two cards to start and can get more by "hitting" or end their turn by "standing"
