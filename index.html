         <p>The object of the game is to beat the dealer's hand by getting a sum of cards as close to 21 as possible without going over. 
             Numbered cards will hold their number value, all face cards are valued at 10 and Ace's can be either 1 or 11.
            To start the game, both the player and dealer are dealt two cards. The player can continue to play by "hitting" to receive an additional card or stand once their ready to end their turn.
            Be careful, going over 21 is an automatic loss! Once the player's turn is over, the dealer completes their turn.
