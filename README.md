### The Gane 
Blackjack is a casino card game that can be played against dealer. The purpose of the game is to get as close as possible to a total hand value of 21 without exceeding, also know as busting, your hand. 

### As a User:
1. I want to be able to see two cards displayed for my hand and only the second of two cards displayed for the dealer's hand.
2. I want to have the option to stand and keep the hand dealt as is or continuously hit, to get one more cards until I choose to stand, reach 21 or exceed 21.
3. I want to see the total value of my hand after each additional card.
3. I want to be able to compete with the dealer to see which player can get 21 or the closet to 21 without exceeding the value.
